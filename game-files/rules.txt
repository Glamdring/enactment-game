Some governments all work towards better results. However, often it happens that politicians within the same government are rivals.
Be part of such a rivalry.

Start with 3 resource cards and 4 morality.
Before the start draw 3 quality cards. Change up to 2.
Draw 1 action card.

Three actions:

- draw an action card
-- in stage 2 you can trade stage 1 cards for new cards
- draw 2 resources (of 5 open on the market, or at random from the top of the pile)
-- you can choose "corruption". If you do, draw 4 resource cards, and lose 2 morality and 1 target
-- at this step you can trade 4 of any resource for an action card
-- a player cannot have more than 5 action cards in his hand and discards one at random
-- if there are 4 resource cards of the same type, discard the market and put 5 new resources
- play a card (either action card or quality card) (can't play more than 2 quality cards in segment 1)
-- when you play a card that gives you resources, draw those resources from the market. If the particular resources are not present, draw from the top of the resource pile
-- if an attacked player does not have a resource of the required type, he choses which resource to discard
-- an attack card (played against another player) can be countered by that player using a "Counter card")
- move your piece (one step forward). You can decide not to move.

Add the start of stage 2 a player can change up to 2 quality cards.

Win condition: finalize a reform with 2 or less off-target
(If a player reaches the end, the rest of the players that haven't played their last turn do so. If two players and up finishing with the same target offset, it's a draw between them)
Lose condition: if you are left with 0 morality
Lose condition: reach the end with 3 or more off-target

Resources are visible to everyone
The rest of the cards are private
